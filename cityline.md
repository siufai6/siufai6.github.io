## Hi I'm Silva

You can call me Silva, or some old friends in my previous jobs used to call me 銀姐. I used to make tea for them (just kidding).

I work in Solution Delivery team. 🚀  
Every now and then Mr. Marcus Lam had a great idea (or given a great idea by his bosses).  Me and Cartman then look for solutions to turn this idea into reality.  

The one thing I like this role is you get to look for new tech/ideas to implement something that others think not quite realistic.  We fail often, but sometimes we make it.

If I'm not working, I like to jog.  I'm quite slow but it's totoally OK.  
I write programs in python to backtest stock trading algorithms (let me tell you there is no crystal ball).
