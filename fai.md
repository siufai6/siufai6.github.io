Hello I'm Fai.

You can call me Fai, or some old friends in my previous jobs used to call me Silva or in Cantonese 銀姐. I used to make tea for them (just kidding).

I worked in a lot of different companies and played different roles.  The range of technology stack evolved from SQL (yes we developed web application using PL/SQL in old days), Java and nowadays Python.  I did coding, requirement analysis, testing to data architect and leading development teams.  

In all these roles what I like most is to find ways to solve problems/bugs.  Sometimes defining the problem itself is the most difficult part. 

If I'm not working, I like to jog.  I ran 🏃‍♀️ in the UNICEF 10 K race  (in Hong Kong) every year for 10 years.   I also play badminton 🏸 (quite well!) and a bit of table tennis 🏓.  I just learnt very briefly how to play tennis 🎾. 

I am very interested in the financial markets 📈 so I write programs in python to backtest stock trading algorithms (let me tell you there is no crystal ball).  

I just moved to the UK in Sept 2022 and am exploring new oppurtunities.  The chance to learn new things (technology/business) is more important than the job title!
